2. **Use a Script**: Write down key points for each section, but speak naturally.

3. **Show Real Examples**: Use realistic medical data (but not real personal info).

4. **Highlight Benefits**: Not just "how to do it" but "why it's useful."

5. **Keep It Engaging**: Vary your tone, use pauses, show enthusiasm.

6. **Test Everything First**: Make sure all features work before recording.

7. **Multiple Takes**: Don't be afraid to re-record sections if needed.

8. **Get Feedback**: Show a draft to someone else before finalizing.
